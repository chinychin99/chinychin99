**Hi, I'm Biak!**

I'm a student at Northeastern University studying Computer Science and Business Admin.

- I'm still pretty new at coding but I'm always excited to learn
- I love building fun and useful apps and tools that people can actually use
- In the future, I hope to explore and build data driven apps

Feel free to reach out to me at biaktchin8@gmail.com!
